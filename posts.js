Iran's elected PM said \u201Cthis is ours\u201D and took the oil back — but two years later, the CIA overthrew him. After the coup, American oil companies got 40% of Iran's oil, from 0% before." },

The spatial blueprint drawn 170 years ago became the economic ceiling of an entire neighbourhood. Hand drawn carts still move through the same lanes. Nothing changed because the map never did." },
      { p: "The Portuguese didn't just map India. They decorated it with elephants, palm trees, exotic flora because to European eyes this land was so overwhelmingly rich they drew it smaller deliberately. Geographic knowledge to them was colonial intelligence, closely guarded, fiercely contested and rarely shared." },

      { p: "India, over the same period, had a much harder starting point. Fewer people could read. Health and nutrition lagged behind. And old social structures around caste and family often meant people couldn't just pack up and take a job somewhere else, or sell their labor freely, the way they needed to." },
